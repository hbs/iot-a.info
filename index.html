        The Internet of Things (IoT) is the concept of an ubiquitous network of 
        devices to facilitate communication between the devices themselves, as 
        well as between the devices and human end users. The involved devices 
        are typically constrained devices such as RFID sensors, but more 
        sophisticated ones like smartphones are also considered to be part
        of the IoT ecosystem. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Processing data from IoT devices lends itself to the Big Data approach, 
        that is, using scale-out techniques on commodity hardware in a 
        schema-on-read fashion along with community-defined interfaces. 
        <em>Why is that so?</em> Well, in order to develop a commercial-grade 
        IoT application you need to be able to capture and store all the incoming
        sensor data to build up the historical references (volume aspect of Big Data).
        Then, there are dozens of data formats in use in the IoT world and none
        of the sensor data is relational per se (variety aspect of Big Data). 
        Last but not least, many devices generate data at a high rate and usually
        we cope with data streams in an IoT context (the velocity aspect of Big Data).
      </p>
      <p>
      In the following we discuss a <a href="http://datadventures.ghost.io/2014/07/06/polyglot-processing/">polyglot processing</a>
      architecture, enabling us to develop and operate IoT applications, at scale: the <em>Internet of Things Architecture</em>
      (or iot-a, for short). It consists of three main building blocks:

        <p>Overview</p>
      </div>
      <ol class="main-blocks">
        <li>
          <strong>MQ/SP</strong> ... the <em>Message Queue/Stream Processing</em> 
          block takes the input data and performs—depending on the application 
          requirements—one or more of the following operations on it:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Buffering: to adapt to the processing speed or throughput characteristics of downstream components,
              it often is necessary to buffer inbound data points. Equally, through micro-batching data points, 
              the ingestion rate into downstream components can be increased.
            </li>
            <li>
              Filtering: ranging from simple cleansing operation to application-specific removal of certain data points.
            </li>
            <li>
              Complex online processing over streams: continuous queries, aggregates, counts, 
              real-time machine learning algorithms, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
          The MQ/SP block can produce two kinds of output data: 1. real-time output, and
          (optionally) 2. ingestion output for downstream components (DB and/or DFS).
          <p>
            Example: In an application for the automotive sector, the <em>MQ/SP</em> block might be
            responsible for generating a heads-up text message that is sent to the
            driver of a connected car in the event of a predicted engine malfunction. 
            The most important aspect here is that the alert reaches the user in time,
            potentially preventing an accident.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DB</strong> ... the <em>Database</em> block takes the data from the upstream <em>MQ/SP</em> 
          and provides structured, fine-grained, low-latency access to the data points.
          Due to the nature of the data, the database block is typically a NoSQL solution,
          able to accommodate sparse data, with auto-sharding and horizontal scale-out properties.
          The database block output can is of interactive nature, with an interface provided
          either through a store-specific API (such as the HBase API) or through the standard
          interface SQL.
          <p>
            Example: Staying with the connected car from above, an example usage of the 
            <em>DB</em> block is as follows: a mechanic in a garage can, once the car
            owner approves a service-as-you-go, inspect the car’s vital signal, 
            asking ad-hoc questions and correlate it with other cars of the same 
            build in order to asses potential damage and develop a repair strategy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DFS</strong> ... the <em>Distributed File System</em> block takes the data from 
          either the <em>DB</em> block or directly from the <em>MQ/SP</em> block and 
          performs batch jobs—usually aggregations and reporting type of jobs—over 
          the entire dataset. This might include combining the data from IoT devices 
          with other data sources, such as those delivering customer or product data 
          or potentially unstructured ones, for example PDF documents.
          <p>
            Example: Again in the context of the smart car, an example usage of the 
            <em>DFS</em> block goes as so: the car owner has access to a Web site where, on a 
            weekly basis, metrics about the car, are made available in order for the
            owner to assess the overall health and performance of her vehicle.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        An example configuration of the iot-a is as follows:
